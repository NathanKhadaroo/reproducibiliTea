Our ReproducibiliTEA journal club is open to both staff and students within the Department of Health & Social Sciences at the University of the West of England (UWE). At each meeting, we will discuss a key paper within the theme of 'Replication, Reproducibility and Open Science', with the journal club open to both novices and experts. The journal club will begin with a brief overview of a chosen paper with the remainder of the session dedicated to free discussion amongst attendees. You are also free to host a session yourself! We are hoping for a diverse range of attendees from students to Early Career Researchers and Professors. We hope that this journal club will provide a current overview of the Open Science Movement and invite both skeptics and enthusiasts alike! Given the journal clubs name, it is also essential that our meetings include a good cuppa' tea and biscuits. We look forward to seeing you there and joining the movement.
