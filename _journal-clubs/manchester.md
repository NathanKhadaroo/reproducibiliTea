**About:**
The journal club is open to everyone across the the University of Manchester and nearby universities, from any discipline or department.
We meet on the first Wednesday of every month at 11am in the Third Floor Meeting Room in the Zochonis Building.
The most up-to-date information can generally be found on our [OSF page](https://osf.io/bs2k7/wiki/home/), and we circulate the meeting details through the university's Open Research mailing list which you can join [by signing up here](https://listserv.manchester.ac.uk/cgi-bin/wa?SUBED1=open_research&A=1). 
We also have a Google calendar which you can [find here](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=reprotmanc%40gmail.com&ctz=Europe%2FLondon) or add to your own calendar by following [this link](https://calendar.google.com/calendar?cid=cmVwcm90bWFuY0BnbWFpbC5jb20).

**The format:**
For each session, the presenter will provide a short (5-15mins) overview of the chosen paper with the remainder of the session dedicated to free discussion amongst all attendees.

**Inclusivity:**
Everyone is welcome to join us - skeptics and enthusiasts alike!
We are hoping for a diverse range of attendees from all career stages, disciplines, and backgrounds, and particularly enjoy hearing views views from all perspectives.
Your voice is welcome here, and we offer a friendly atmosphere!
